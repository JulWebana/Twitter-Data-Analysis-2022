In this notebook, we will be building a sentiment analyzer that checks whether tweets about a subject are negative or positive. We will be making use of the Python library textblob and tweepy for this. 

Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and classifying the sentiments expressed in a textual source. Tweets are often useful for generating a large amount of sentiment data after analysis. This data is useful for understanding people's opinions on a variety of topics.

Sentiment analysis can be performed in many different ways. Many brands and marketers use keyword-based tools that classify data (i.e. social, news, review, blog, etc.) as positive/negative/neutral.
